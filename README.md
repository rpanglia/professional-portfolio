# Professional-Portfolio

**Introduction**

The following repository contains the newely created (and under-major-construction) professional portfolio of Ravneet Panglia. As a developer-in-training, building a professional portfolio is critical to showcase my work as I progress in this coding bootcamp course. 

Please see below the requirements and expectations for this assignment:

*User Story*
    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

*Acceptance Criteria*
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

**Viewing my Professional Portfolio**
Option A: Direct Link to Portfolio --> https://rpanglia.github.io/professional-portfolio/ 

Option B: View Portfolio through GitHub --> https://github.com/rpanglia/professional-portfolio

Option C: 
    1. Highlight this link (https://rpanglia.github.io/professional-portfolio/), right-click and click on "Copy" OR press and hold "Ctrl+C" to copy highlighted link
    2. Open your internet browser's URL (uniform resource launder) or address bar located at top of browser page
    3. Right-click to click on "Paste" OR press and hold "Ctrl+V" to paste highlighted link 
    4. Hit the "Enter" key to launch The Panglia Portfolio webpage on your device
    

**Challenges**

This challenge was challenging (pun intended), as there was no starter code provided. Everything you see on the live webpage (the good, the bad and the VERY ugly) are what I put together. As you can see, there is a lot of work that needs to be done on my end to produce cleaner code and visually appealing content (CSS-you will be on my side one day). But hey, it's a process isn't it? To be clear, it is one that I am committed to and will continue working on.

As per the acceptance criteria, I tried my best to hit as many points possible. I was not able to provide titled images of my applications in the "Work" section. Unfortunately, I also was not able to create a responsive webpage in time. A very important feature that allows users of various devices to view content. 


**Future Goals**

Utilize resources available to assist in meeting the acceptance criteri, gain better insights and improve outcomes for future projects. Make mistakes, learn from the mistakes, apply learnings to grow!

**Conclusion**

Thank you for having a read and please come back in the future to see the progress that WILL be made!

Best,
Ravneet
